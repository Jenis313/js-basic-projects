#JAVASCRIPT BASIC PROJECTS
This repo contains some of the javascript projects that I made throughout my learning journey.

#1) COLOR FLIPPER
This is a very simple project and all it does is changes its background color when the button is clicked.

#2) COUNTER
Another very simple project which can be used for counting which has 3 buttons, increase, decrease and reset. If count goes above 0 its color will be green and if it goes under 0 its color will be red otherwise it will stay black.

#3) Review carousel
#4)Expanding Cards
The card will be expanded on mouse hover event.
